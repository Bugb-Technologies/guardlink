# GuardLink CI — Copy to your project's .github/workflows/guardlink.yml
#
# What it does:
#   1. Validates annotations (syntax errors, dangling refs, duplicate IDs)
#   2. Shows threat model diff on PRs (what security posture changed)
#   3. Uploads unmitigated exposures to GitHub Security tab via SARIF
#   4. Posts a coverage summary as a PR comment
#
# For multi-repo workspaces, see examples/ci/ which adds report JSON
# generation and a weekly workspace merge workflow.
